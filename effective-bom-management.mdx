## Overview

BOM (Bill of Materials) management is a key aspect of hardware design. Good BOM management not only improves design efficiency but also significantly reduces costs and ensures on-time project delivery. This guide will teach you how to establish an efficient BOM management system.

## Core BOM Management Principles

### 1. Standardization Principle

- Unified naming conventions
- Consistent parameter formats
- Standardized classification system

### 2. Traceability Principle

- Complete change records
- Clear version control
- Detailed source information

### 3. Cost Control Principle

- Real-time price monitoring
- Alternative solution management
- Bulk procurement optimization

## BOM Structure Design

### 1. Hierarchical Structure

**Top Level: Product BOM**

```
