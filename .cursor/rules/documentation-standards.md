# Documentation Standards

## File Organization
- All documentation files should be in `.mdx` format for Mintlify compatibility
- Use descriptive filenames that match the content (e.g., `getting-started.mdx`, `api-reference.mdx`)
- Keep file names lowercase with hyphens for spaces
- Group related files in appropriate directories

## Content Structure
- Every page must start with YAML frontmatter containing title and description
- Use clear, hierarchical headings (H2, H3, H4)
- Include a table of contents for longer pages
- End pages with related links or next steps

## Writing Guidelines
- Write for your target audience (technical users, developers, end users)
- Use active voice and present tense
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Include practical examples and use cases
- Test all code examples before publishing

## Review Process
- All content must be reviewed for accuracy and clarity
- Code examples must be tested and verified
- Links must be checked for validity
- Screenshots and images must be current and relevant

## Maintenance
- Update documentation when features change
- Remove outdated information promptly
- Keep examples current with latest versions
- Regular review cycles for accuracy
