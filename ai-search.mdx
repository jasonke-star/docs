## How to Use AI Search

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Search Page">
  After logging into PartGenie, you'll see the main search interface
  
  <Info>
  The search bar is located in the center of the page with the prompt "Enter component model, parameters, or describe the problem you want to solve..."
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Search Requirements">
  Enter your requirements in the search bar using natural language: **Simple
  description:** ``` "Need a 3.3V voltage regulator" ``` **Detailed
  description:** ``` "LDO voltage regulator, input 5V, output 3.3V, current 1A,
  SOT-23 package" ``` **Application scenario:** ``` "Power management chip for
  Arduino project" ```
</Step>

<Step title="View Search Results">
  AI will intelligently analyze your requirements and return a list of matching
  components
  <Tip>
    Results are sorted by relevance, with the most matching products displayed
    as cards at the top of the overview tab
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Filter and Optimize">
  You can use filters in the components tab to further narrow your search:
  - **Operating Voltage**: Select appropriate voltage range
  - **Package Type**: Choose suitable package
</Step>
</Steps>

## Search Strategies

### Search Types

<Table>
  | Search Type | Keyword Strategy | Example |
  |-------------|------------------|---------| | Function Search | Use
  functional description words | "voltage regulator", "amplifier", "converter" |
  | Parameter Search | Include specific values | "3.3V", "1A", "100MHz" | |
  Application Search | Describe usage scenarios | "Arduino", "automotive",
  "industrial" | | Brand Search | Specify manufacturer | "ST", "TI", "ADI" |
</Table>

<Step title="Multi-angle Search">
  1. Search from functional perspective 2. Search from parameter perspective 3.
  Search from application perspective 4. Combine multiple angles
</Step>

<Step title="Learn from Search Results">
  1. Analyze result relevance
  2. Adjust search keywords
  3. Optimize search strategy
</Step>
</Steps>
