---

## Overview

In PartGenie, writing high-quality queries is key to getting precise component recommendations. This guide will teach you how to construct query statements that AI can accurately understand and process.

## Query Structure Elements

### 1. Clearly Specify Component Type

**❌ Vague Query:**

```
I need an electronic component
```

**✅ Precise Query:**

```
I need an N-channel MOSFET transistor for power management, TO-220 package
```

### 2. Include Key Electrical Parameters

**Example Parameters:**

- Voltage rating (e.g., 12V, 24V, 400V)
- Current capacity (e.g., 1A, 5A, 20A)
- Power rating (e.g., 1W, 5W, 100W)
- Frequency range (e.g., 1MHz, 100MHz, 1GHz)
- Operating temperature (e.g., -40°C to +85°C)

**❌ Incomplete Query:**

```
I need a voltage regulator
```

**✅ Complete Query:**

```
I need a 3.3V LDO voltage regulator, 1A output current, SOT-23 package, for Arduino project
```

### 3. Describe Application Context

**Application Context Elements:**

- **Project Type**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, industrial control, automotive
- **Function**: Power supply, signal processing, communication, sensing
- **Environment**: Indoor, outdoor, high temperature, low power
- **Performance Requirements**: High speed, low noise, low power consumption

**Example:**

```
I need a temperature sensor for an Arduino weather station project, measuring outdoor temperature from -20°C to +60°C, I2C interface, low power consumption
```

## Query Writing Best Practices

### 1. Use Natural Language

**Good Examples:**

- "I need a microcontroller for IoT projects with WiFi capability"
- "Looking for a power MOSFET that can handle 20A at 12V"
- "Need a low-noise operational amplifier for audio applications"

### 2. Be Specific About Requirements

**Include:**
- Exact specifications when known
- Tolerance requirements
- Package preferences
- Brand preferences (if any)
- Cost constraints

### 3. Use Technical Terminology

**Preferred Terms:**
- "microcontroller" instead of "chip"
- "voltage regulator" instead of "power component"
- "operational amplifier" instead of "amp"

## Common Query Patterns

### Pattern 1: Function + Parameters

```
[Component Type] + [Key Parameters] + [Package/Interface]
```

**Example:**
```
STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, 72MHz ARM Cortex-M3, 64KB Flash, LQFP48 package
```

### Pattern 2: Application + Requirements

```
[Application] + [Performance Requirements] + [Interface/Communication]
```

**Example:**
```
Temperature sensor for industrial monitoring, -40°C to +125°C range, 4-20mA output, DIN rail mounting
```

### Pattern 3: Replacement/Alternative

```
[Original Part] + [Replacement Requirements] + [Constraints]
```

**Example:**
```
Alternative to LM358 op-amp, same pinout, better noise performance, automotive grade
```

## Advanced Query Techniques

### 1. Comparative Queries

```
Compare STM32F103 vs STM32F407 microcontrollers for motor control applications
```

### 2. Optimization Queries

```
Find the most cost-effective 3.3V LDO regulator with lowest dropout voltage
```

### 3. Compatibility Queries

```
What components are compatible with Arduino Uno for I2C communication?
```

## Query Examples by Category

### Microcontrollers

**Good Query:**
```
I need a 32-bit ARM microcontroller for a robotics project, 100+ MHz, 256KB+ Flash, CAN bus support, QFP package
```

**Poor Query:**
```
I need a microcontroller
```

### Power Management

**Good Query:**
```
Looking for a buck converter IC, input 12V, output 5V 2A, 90%+ efficiency, SOT-23 package
```

**Poor Query:**
```
I need a power supply chip
```

### Sensors

**Good Query:**
```
Need a digital humidity sensor for greenhouse monitoring, I2C interface, 0-100% RH range, ±2% accuracy
```

**Poor Query:**
```
I need a humidity sensor
```

### Communication

**Good Query:**
```
Looking for a WiFi module for ESP32, 802.11 b/g/n, integrated antenna, SPI interface, low power mode
```

**Poor Query:**
```
I need a WiFi chip
```

## Troubleshooting Query Issues

### If Results Are Too Broad

**Problem:** Too many results, not specific enough
**Solution:** Add more specific parameters or constraints

### If No Results Found

**Problem:** Query too specific or using wrong terminology
**Solution:** Try broader terms or alternative descriptions

### If Results Don't Match Needs

**Problem:** Missing key requirements in query
**Solution:** Include more context about application and constraints

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow Down**
   - Begin with general component type
   - Add specific parameters gradually
   - Use filters to refine results

2. **Use Multiple Search Attempts**
   - Try different keyword combinations
   - Use synonyms and alternative terms
   - Search by different aspects (function, parameters, application)

3. **Learn from Search Results**
   - Analyze what terms appear in good results
   - Note common parameter formats
   - Build vocabulary from successful searches

4. **Save Successful Queries**
   - Keep track of queries that work well
   - Build a personal query library
   - Share effective patterns with team

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Too Vague
❌ "I need a chip"
✅ "I need a 16-bit ADC for sensor reading"

### 2. Missing Units
❌ "I need a 3.3 regulator"
✅ "I need a 3.3V voltage regulator"

### 3. Wrong Terminology
❌ "I need a computer chip"
✅ "I need a microcontroller"

### 4. Too Many Requirements
❌ "I need a perfect microcontroller that does everything"
✅ "I need a microcontroller with specific features for my project"

## Conclusion
