## Best Practices

### Asking Effective Questions

<Steps>
<Step title="Be Specific">
  Ask specific questions rather than general ones
  - Good: "What is the maximum operating temperature?"
  - Avoid: "Tell me about this chip"
</Step>

<Step title="Use Technical Terms">
  Use proper technical terminology when possible - Good: "What is the quiescent
  current?" - Good: "What is the supply voltage range?"
</Step>

<Step title="Ask Follow-up Questions">
  Build on previous answers for deeper understanding
  - "What about at higher temperatures?"
  - "How does this affect power consumption?"
</Step>
</Steps>

### Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Component Selection">
- Compare multiple options
- Verify specifications
- Check compatibility
- Understand trade-offs
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Design Validation">
  - Confirm design requirements - Check operating conditions - Verify
  performance specs - Identify potential issues
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Learning and Research">
- Understand new components
- Learn about applications
- Explore alternatives
- Deepen technical knowledge
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Component Comparison

You can compare multiple components in a single conversation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Components">
  Choose multiple products for comparison
</Step>

<Step title="Ask Comparison Questions">
  "Compare the power consumption of these three chips"
</Step>

<Step title="Get Side-by-Side Analysis">
  Receive detailed comparison tables and analysis
</Step>
</Steps>

### Context-Aware Responses

The AI maintains context throughout the conversation:

<Info>
  You can refer to previous questions and answers in follow-up questions
</Info>

**Example:**

- Q: "What is the operating voltage?"
- A: "The operating voltage is 3.3V"
- Q: "What about the current consumption at that voltage?"
- A: "At 3.3V, the current consumption is 15mA typical"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="No Response">
If the AI doesn't respond:
1. Check if the question is clear
2. Try rephrasing the question
3. Break complex questions into simpler ones
4. Contact support if the issue persists
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Inaccurate Information">
  If you get incorrect information: 1. Verify the question was understood
  correctly 2. Try asking more specifically 3. Report the issue to support 4.
  Cross-reference with official datasheet
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Technical Limitations">
Some limitations to be aware of:
- Very recent products may have limited information
- Complex technical calculations may not be supported
- Always verify critical specifications independently
</Accordion>
