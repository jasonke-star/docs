title: "From Fuzzy Intent to Precise Solutions"
---

## Overview

In hardware design, we often start with a vague idea like "I need to build a smart device" or "I want to control a motor." This guide will teach you how to transform these fuzzy intents into specific component selection solutions.

## Fuzzy Intent Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Requirement Decomposition

Break down vague intents into specific technical requirements:

**Original Intent:** "I want to build a smart home controller"

**Decomposition Steps:**

1. **Functional Requirements**: What devices to control? What sensors are needed?
2. **Communication Requirements**: How to communicate with phone or cloud?
3. **Power Requirements**: Battery powered or mains powered?
4. **Environmental Requirements**: Indoor or outdoor? Temperature range?
5. **Cost Constraints**: Budget range?

### Step 2: Technical Specification Definition

Based on decomposed requirements, define specific technical specifications:

```
Smart Home Controller Technical Specifications:
- Microcontroller: ARM Cortex-M4, at least 256KB Flash
- Communication: WiFi + Bluetooth dual mode
- Sensors: Temperature/humidity, light, motion detection
- Control Output: 4-channel relay, 10A per channel
- Power: 12V DC input, built-in 5V/3.3V conversion
- Operating Temperature: -10°C to +60°C
- Cost Target: < $50
```
